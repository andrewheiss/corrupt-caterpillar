Article searching and coding workflow as of 
2023/01/13

1. Pilot round of article searches
2. Decided on search conditions for 3 NPO + 4 PA journals
3. Final Round of search
4. Quick droping of clear conceptual/qualitative artices from the search engine results before exporting
5. One more round of sifting out conceptual/qualitative/associational articles as coding the articles 
6. coding of causal studies (qualified and quasi-qualified) 
Notes: quasi-qualified means using DiD, RD etc. but not using correctly...

Search Decisions:
2023/01/14: 
1. Include 2022 in the searches, to decide what to do later with online first ones- drop or code as 2023
2. When doing coding in parallel with updating searches, for conceptual/qualitative/associational papers, add *tags* as "conceptual", "qualitative" or "associational" but *DO NOT* yet move them out to "dropped" folders for the moment. When search updating is finished. Move out those papers in the last step.
