1. Pilot round of article searches
2. Decided on search conditions for 3 NPO + 4 PA journals
3. Final Round of search
4. Quick droping of clear conceptual/qualitative artices from the search engine results before exporting
5. One more round of sifting out conceptual/qualitative/associational articles as coding the articles 
6. coding of causal studies (qualified and quasi-qualified) 
Notes: quasi-qualified means using DiD, RD etc. but not using correctly...
