### Note on “corrupt caterpillar” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change. The seed `1022` was
generated with random atmospheric noise at
[random.org](https://www.random.org/).

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0
codename(type = "ubuntu", seed = 1022)
#> [1] "corrupt caterpillar"
```
