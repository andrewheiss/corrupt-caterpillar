### üëøüêõ: Note on ‚Äúcorrupt caterpillar‚Äù project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won‚Äôt change. The seed `1022` was
generated with random atmospheric noise at
[random.org](https://www.random.org/).

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0
codename(type = "ubuntu", seed = 1022)
#> [1] "corrupt caterpillar"
```

## How to replicate

You can either [download the compendium as a ZIP
file](/archive/main.zip) or use GitHub to clone or fork the compendium
repository (see the green ‚ÄúCode‚Äù button at the top of the GitHub page).

We use the [**renv**
package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to create a
stable version-specific library of packages, and we use the [**targets**
package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to manage all file
dependencies and run the analysis. To reproduce the findings and re-run
the analysis, do the following:

1.  Download and install these fonts:
    -   [Cochineal](https://fontesk.com/cochineal-typeface/)
    -   [Econ
        Sans](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes/tree/master/inst/fonts/econ-sans)
    -   [Linux Libertine
        O](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/linux-libertine-o) (also
        [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxlibertine/))
    -   [Libertinus Math](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus)
    -   [InconsolataGo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/InconsolataGo)
2.  [Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (and preferably
    [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)).
    -   If you‚Äôre using macOS, [install XQuartz
        too](https://www.xquartz.org/), so that you have access to the
        Cairo graphics library
3.  Open `corrupt-caterpillar.Rproj` to open an [RStudio
    Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
4.  Make sure you have a working installation of LaTeX:
    -   *Easy-and-recommended way*: Install the [**tinytex**
        package](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) by running
        `install.packages("tinytex")` in the R console, then running
        `tinytex::install_tinytex()`
    -   *Easy-but-requires-huge-4+-GB-download way*: Download TeX Live
        ([macOS](http://www.tug.org/mactex/);
        [Windows](https://miktex.org/))
5.  If it‚Äôs not installed already, R *should* try to install the
    **renv** package when you open the RStudio Project for the first
    time. If you don‚Äôt see a message about package installation, install
    it yourself by running `install.packages("renv")` in the R console.
6.  Run `renv::restore()` in the R console to install all the required
    packages for this project.
7.  Run `targets::tar_make()` in the R console to automatically download
    all data files, process the data, run the analysis, and compile the
    paper and appendix.

Running `targets::tar_make()` will create several helpful outputs:

1.  All project data in `data/`
2.  An analysis notebook website in `analysis/_site/index.html`
3.  PDF, HTML, and Word versions of the manuscript in
    `manuscript/output/`
